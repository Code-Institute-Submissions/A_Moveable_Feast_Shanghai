## User Experience (UX)

* User Stories 
 
 1. First Time Visitor Goals

    a. First time visitors should be able to clearly access all materials that inform the user of possible events organised by A Moveable Feast. 
        There is an alert for covid related information that opens on a new page. The logo is clickable and the navbar contains links to the homepage, 
        feast (info regarding events), a gallery and a signup sheet. 
        
    b. The colours are attracted to the eye and do not detracted from the images.  On the homepage 
        or landing page the new user will learn about A Moveable Feast's hope to connect people to great new food and beverage offerings arouned the Shanghai. The 
        footer links to all social media links including facebook, twitter, instagram and wechat.
    
        
    c. Upon clicking the Feast page you see the offerings of local food nights, international food and drinks night. The utensil icons and cocktail icon also link to the sign up page.


    d. The sign up page is a smiple box that asks for the first user to sign up to receive invites to nights out in different restaurants. The user is encouraged to choose their preference between local, international and a bar night. 

    e. Finally the gallery page shows images of the many different types of food on offer as a means of enticing the new customer. 

    f. The pdf alert is there to offer reasurance to the user. It also has a QR code link to the city tracking app and a moveable feasts wechat account where customers can easily meassge any queries. 

 2. Returning Visitor Goals 

     Returning users can access any information they may have forgotten and use the active social media sites and we chat account. 

    

 3. Frequent User Goals 

    This is static site so less things will change and there will be little need for frequent users. Users can return to check if any images have been updated. 
          
 ### Photo story for first time user

 ![A Moveable Feast homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](images/homepage.png) "A Moveable Feast on multiple displays"

 The user will find images of the city, food and market dining options. There is also an easy to use navbar that links easily to the gallery, dining option informationa and finally the contact section. The landing page also explains the idea behind the website. Due to Covid many people are concerned over eating in public or especially dining out with strangers. This alsert is hopefully temporary but guides the user to QR codes that help register the health info of the user but also an account for further information.

# Design 

  ## Color Scheme  

  * Three main colors where chosen. Two were blue hues while the final is a white background. This a food based website, 
     so the added effect of text and images on a white background was to give  the illusion of  menu. The color was also inspired by the logo itself.  
     Colors are #13baec, white,  and #1339e4.

 ## Typography 
    
  * Font used is Montserrat. It has a long history, is easy to read and suits the concept of a food website. Sans Serif should be the fall back font as is the industry standard and is compatible on most devices. 

 ## Imagery

  * Images used were some of my own and also stock images taken from unsplash. The images were used to first engage with the food images and then with those who participate in the events and finally with the different types of restaurtant. 
    Images must depict diverse tastes and interests in order to attract a many and varied crowd. 
  
## Features  

* Responsive on all devices and have interactive elements for bookings. Icons that link to further social media updates.

## Wireframes

* Wireframe for the whole project. [View](wireframe/amf.pdf)

![Lighthouse Performance 93%, Accessibilty 93%, Best Practices 95%, SEO 100% on desktop](images/lighthouse.png) "Lighthouse score for the websites user efficency."

Dev tools for google was also used to test the websites preformance. Lighthouse flagged that when using target="_blank" and additional instruction of rel="noopener" needed to be added to protect security.
Lighthouse performance on mobile was lower,  Performance 60%, Accessibilty 95%, Best Practices 93% and SEO 100%.

### Bugs

#### Gallery

While developing the site some issues were raised. In the gallery page, there were three main bugs that had to be resolved. 

1. This bug involved the lack of padding between the images. In the CSS I targeted the padding-bottom to remedy this problem. 

2. On mobile device it lost all padding and so by asking a tutor for guidance and also looking at dev tools we were able to use some css to fix it.  
.col-sm-4 {

    padding: 10px;   
}

3. When the gallery images were on a mobile device the would appear to the left the screen when I wanted them in the center. Stackoverflow provided a solution to this which I then worked on for A Moveable Feast 

.center-block {

  display: block;

  margin-right: auto;

  margin-left: auto;

}

#### Navbar

* Because the logo was designed on Wix and was white, I had to target the color because bootstrap overrides the border color. 
  I did this by making the navbar background-color white in the style sheet. 


 #### Form 

 * This was the most difficult to control but by making the margin: auto it became responsive and also by adding d-flex from bootstrap.

 * Code Institute Tutorials for providing a jumping off block. 

 * Slack for being a great source of help with either googling or when other students have provided suggestions to help improve your work. 

 ### Individuals

 * My Mentor, Allen Thomas Varghese is a great help. 

 * Tutors at Code Institute are great guiding hand.   They do not give you the answer but ask the right questions to lead you down the correct path. It also helps build confidence. 

 * Anne Greaves and Code Institute for a comprehensive guide to writing README.md. The template was taken from the Code Institute Guide to writing README and how to write Markdown.

 * Alex Harvey, a guide to writing a table of contents in gitpod. 

#### Code

* The alert as an idea was a nod to the whiskey drop site we developed via code institute. 
  When researching other food tour companies I also noticed some had considered Covid19 and 
  their business so thought it was appropriate to add a pdf to guide the user to policy and 
  also a QR code that could be used as a means of registration. My limitations means I was 
  unable to fully add this to the site. One such website was untour foodtour that had an alert for it's cutomers. 

* The Navbar was found while researching Bootstrap and was used because it was responsive and 
  would help with making my site first. I did have to overide some elements as is mentioned in the bugs section. 

* The footer was learned from the Love running mini project but was again adapted for my own needs.
