  ## Design 

  * Color Scheme  

    Bright but relaxing colors  

  * Typography 
    
    What font do I intend to use? Sans Serif should be the fall back font as is the industry standard and is compatible on most devices. 

  * Imagery

    Images are incredibly important but it will attract the cutomer to the organisation. They will first engage with the food images. Then with those who participate in the events and finally with the different types of restaurtant. Images must depict diverse tastes and interests in order to attract a many and varied crowd.
